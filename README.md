# FinalYearProject

In this project, we used UCI repository data of liver functioninig and predicted the presence of liver disease in a patient using various machine learning algorithms like logistic regression, Naive Bayes classifier, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, etc.

We also improved the accuracy of the machine learning algorithms by using a genetic algorithm to better understand which features to use for the purpouse of training.

We published our findings in the following paper : https://www.annalsofrscb.ro/index.php/journal/article/view/2768/2300
